# Report - Statiscal Learning Theory (SLT) - Creating my own regression KNN algorithm in Python

* The activity from the SLT subject in my MSc degree in Computer Science was to develop my own version of the KNN algorithm which should be generalized for any number of inputs. 

* Also, it shouldn't use the Euclidian Distance, so I implemented the KNN algorithm using the Manhattan Distance metric.

* KNN algorithm for K=5 in the [x1=2,x2=-2] coordinate. The visualization was zoomed, and it shows the K nearest points (in blue) and the predicted point (in red). 

## A screenshot of my report, you can read the full report of the implementation in Report_Statiscal_Learning_Theory_KNN.pdf
